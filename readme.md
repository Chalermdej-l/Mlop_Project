## Problem Statement

This project leverages concepts learned from the[MLOps Zoomcamp](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/mlops-zoomcamp) course to implement a robust Machine Learning pipeline. By effectively training, evaluating, and selecting the optimal Machine Learning model, we aim to deploy it to a production environment while continuously monitoring its performance.

Utilizing the [Bank Marketing](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/henriqueyamahata/bank-marketing?select=bank-additional-full.csv) dataset sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), our objective is to predict the likelihood of customers subscribing to a bank term deposit.

Traditionally, reaching out to customers to gauge their interest in a bank term deposit involves resource-intensive methods such as individual phone calls. With the vast number of customer accounts, this approach proves time-consuming and inefficient. To address this challenge and optimize the allocation of resources and time, we propose a Machine Learning solution. By training the model on historical customer data, including information gathered during the account creation process, and leveraging insights from previous marketing campaigns, we aim to predict whether a customer is likely to respond positively or negatively to a term deposit offer. This predictive capability empowers stakeholders to strategically target the most receptive audience, enhancing the efficacy of marketing campaigns.

The proposed model is designed to be integrated into the bank's internal systems, accessible via an API endpoint. The marketing department can input customer information lists, and in return, receive predictions indicating whether each client is likely to subscribe to the term deposit or not. This streamlined approach ensures informed decision-making and enables the optimization of marketing efforts for higher success rates.

Ultimately, this project showcases the application of MLOps principles in addressing real-world business challenges, illustrating the power of Machine Learning in enhancing marketing strategies and resource allocation within the banking industry.
